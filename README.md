# Introduction
Create simple unit testing sample and understand good naming and generation of samples ...

The inspiration for this is taken from this article https://testdriven.io/blog/modern-tdd/ 

# Setup

1. Install `pip install -U pytest`

2. [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is the test framework used by the article

3. Documentation can be found https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html

4. Running the tests through python I setup `python3 -m pytest `
